        <b>Intelligence, the Pinnacle of Search</b><br><br><br>

        The building blocks of the universe constitute the ultimate search space, containing all possible combinations and arrangements that are accounted for by physics.<br><br>

        <b>A Needle in the Haystack</b><br>
        Imagine trying to open an abandoned safe that you have just found on a junk yard. The only information that you have is that its passcode is made up of exactly 10 digits. You would have to go through up to 1010 possible variations. A computer program written in the programming language C would need up to 25 seconds to find the right combination (Intel i7 8th gen Laptop chip). Extending the length of the passcode by 8 digits would result in a search space with up to 1018 possible combinations, which would require up to 100 years of search.<br>
        The search space of this particular search problem certainly sounds large, but is of staggeringly minute size when compared to the search space that Earth is grappling with since its formation some 4.5 billion years ago. Earth contains a search space with far more permutations of a far more varied set of variable elements. Hidden within this search space was the human design. Homo sapiens first surfaced 300,000 years ago. Equipped with intelligence, humans brought about various miraculous creations that were, until very recently, out of reach. Intelligence is a new catalyst that Earth had bestowed upon itself.<br><br>

        <b>Begetting branches, begetting branches, begetting branches...</b><br>
        The iPhone is a marvel of human-led engineering. It is the result of decades of human ingenuity and is, as such, the culmination of efforts spanning thousands of years. The iPhone is like a leaf on a tree, a search tree to be specific. The tree trunk marks the starting point. A tree trunk begetting branches, begetting branches, begetting branches, culminates in a delicate leaf. The leaf, as represented by the iPhone, is predicated on industrial design that is tailored to mass production. Its supply chain is enabled by decades of technological advances that have ultimately seeped into humanity’s corpus of knowledge. The iPhone can only exist if all quintessential technologies coexist and come together perfectly. The branches of this search tree map to interdependent parts of the search space that are connected akin to tree branches wherein bifurcating branches represent the hierarchical dependencies that interconnect any given search space. New Technologies are as unlikely to be realized as leaves are likely to flourish on clipped off tree branches.<br>
        All human endeavors are fundamentally concerned with finding and realizing yet unreachable parts of the search space, parts that are far too complex to spontaneously come into existence. The process involved in manifesting these is arduous and lengthy and behaves akin to a labyrinth with a network of interlocking paths. This inherent quality of search spaces obfuscates the path that one must take to find the part of the search space that contains the answer to one’s problem.<br>
        Humanity has brought about the iPhone, commercial airplanes, vaccines and many more things that we have all come to depend on. All the answers to every one of our problems lie hidden within this search space, and intelligence has proven itself an unparalleled tool for traversing it, even whilst being contained within the structure of the brain.<br><br>

        <b>In the Wake of Intelligence, there was Man</b><br>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to replicate and improve upon intelligence in the way as it is conjured up by the brain. Conventional programming techniques outline procedures for a given problem. Resulting computer programs have been the driving force of the digital revolution. Programming 1.0, as it is called by some, is strikingly ill-equipped for tasks wherein the procedures cannot be well defined. Self-driving cars and gameplay agents for chess and the likes require AI based techniques that use machine learning architectures that are trained on large datasets with the ability to improve by way of self-play.<br>
        Chess grand master Garry Kasparov was defeated in 1997 by the chess computer system Deep Blue. The system successfully applied brute-force search to search spaces containing stupendously many future moves, in an attempt to find the one that yield the best outcome. 20 years later, the machine learning system AlphaGo successfully beat a top player at the strategy board game Go. Go has an exponentially larger search space (think safe passcode vs earth’s search space) that was, unlike chess, not germane to the relatively crude “brute force” search approach that was successfully applied to chess some decades prior.<br>
        “AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents” (The Bitter Lesson). “[T]his always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researchers” (The Bitter Lesson), but leads to plateaus in the long term. Plateaus that can inhibit further progress. “[B]reakthrough[s] [are eventually achieved] by an opposing approach” (The Bitter Lesson) that leverages ever increasing amounts of computation to enable superior computationally intensive machine learning architectures that implement search and learning.<br><br>

        Human level intelligence is encapsulated within the brain’s genetically fixed structure. Average Intelligence therefore does not increase among the human populace. AI systems, on the other hand, show steady improvements in their breath and depth of applicability, in line with massive increases in computation made available by Moore's Law. AI will be an ever more indispensable force for maintaining an accelerating rate of innovation.<br>
        One key is a key to a thousand other, AI is the key to all the other.
