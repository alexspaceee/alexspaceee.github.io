What are animals without without a body,<br>
what is a thought without the memories,<br><br>

that fashion, form and color it,<br><br>

give it clothes and give a name to it,<br><br>

a face to wear and a pulse to quicken,<br><br>

and...<br><br>

in the blink of an eye, and with a gust of wind, the thought then vanished, bygone!<br>
At last!
