          A troubled form along the cliff there hurries,<br>
          to the sure end he for ever scurries.<br>
          In his features the worries deep-set,<br>
          for the day his soul is to move ahead.<br>
          In his prime his thoughts there wandered,<br>
          wondering why, wondering when.<br>
          Yet the world spinned on another,<br>
          another day, forever and then.<br><br>

          This planet blue, the stage of any,<br>
          a home for all, the nest for many.<br>
          Now wings will spread and the gust will tell,<br>
          of the dawn in the making and the darkness as well.<br><br>

          The spark was born,<br>
          on the hearth it kindled.<br>
          Now it must spread,<br>
          among them commingle.<br>
          On Mars on Venus and on it must go,<br>
          to safeguard all life and cushion a fall.
