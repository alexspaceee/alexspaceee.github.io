          A troubled form along the cliff there hurries,<b>
          to the sure end he for ever scurries.<b>
          In his features the worries deep-set,<b>
          for the day his soul is to move ahead.<b>
          In his prime his thoughts there wandered,<b>
          wondering why, wondering when.<b>
          Yet the world spinned on another,<b>
          another day, forever and then.<b><b>

          This planet blue, the stage of any,<b>
          a home for all, the nest for many.<b>
          Now wings will spread and the gust will tell,<b>
          of the dawn in the making and the darkness as well.<b><b>

          The spark was born,<b>
          on the hearth it kindled.<b>
          Now it must spread,<b>
          among them commingle.<b>
          On Mars on Venus and on it must go,<b>
          to safeguard all life and cushion a fall.
